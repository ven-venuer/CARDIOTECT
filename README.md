#  Cardiotect - Automated Coronary Calcium Scoring

**A deep learning system for automated coronary calcium scoring from CT scans.**

This project uses artificial intelligence to detect and score calcium deposits in coronary arteries, helping with early detection of heart disease. **You don't need any programming experience to use this!**

##  **For Complete Beginners - How to Get This Project**

### **Step 1: Download the Project**
1. **Click the green "Code" button** at the top of this GitHub page
2. **Select "Download ZIP"** from the dropdown menu
3. **Save the ZIP file** to your Desktop (or any folder you like)
4. **Extract the ZIP file** by right-clicking it and selecting "Extract All"
5. **Open the extracted folder** - you should see files like `start_cardiotect_web.bat`, `README.md`, etc.

### **Step 2: Install Required Software**
You need **Python** and **Git LFS** (for large model files). Here's how:

1. **Install Python 3.8 or newer**:
   - Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Download the latest version for Windows
   - **IMPORTANT**: During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
   - Click "Install Now"

2. **Install Git (optional, for updates)**:
   - Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
   - Download and install with default settings
   - This allows you to get updates easily

### **Step 3: Run the Application**
1. **Navigate to the extracted folder**
2. **Double-click `start_cardiotect_web.bat`**
3. **Wait** - The first time will take 5-10 minutes to:
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install all required packages
   - Download necessary components
4. **The web interface will open automatically** in your default browser

**That's it!** You're now ready to use Cardiotect.

##  **How to Use Cardiotect**

### **Basic Workflow:**
1. **Launch the application** using `start_cardiotect_web.bat`
2. **Upload a CT scan** (DICOM format) using the web interface
3. **Click "Run Analysis"** - The AI will process the scan
4. **View results** - Calcium scores and visualizations appear automatically

### **What You Need:**
- **CT scan files** in DICOM format (.dcm files)
- **Patient folder** containing the DICOM files
- **Optional**: XML annotation files for ground truth comparison

##  **Dataset Configuration**

**The medical dataset is available for research purposes.**

### **Download the Dataset**
1. **Click here to download**: [Dataset on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lXYljyt6LyiaRucqfdc7J4DjdiRBWTQ_?usp=sharing)
2. **Extract the downloaded ZIP file** to any folder on your computer
3. **Note the folder path** where you extracted it

### **Set Up the Dataset**
1. **Edit the `.env` file** in the project root
2. **Set your dataset path**:
   ```
   CARDIOTECT_DATASET_ROOT=C:\path\to\extracted\dataset
   ```
3. **The dataset already follows the correct structure** - no changes needed

##  **Model Checkpoints**

**Pre-trained AI models are included!** You don't need to download anything extra.

- **Location**: `outputs/checkpoints/`
- **Files**: `best.ckpt` and `latest.ckpt`
- **How they work**: The application automatically loads these when you start it
- **No setup required** - they work out of the box

---

##  **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **"Python not found" error**
- Reinstall Python and **check "Add Python to PATH"**
- Restart your computer after installation

### **"Checkpoint not found" error**
- Make sure you downloaded the **complete ZIP file**
- Don't move individual files - keep the folder structure intact
- Try re-downloading and extracting the ZIP

### **"Module not found" errors**
- Run `setup.bat` manually (in the `extras` folder)
- Or delete the `venv` folder and run `start_cardiotect_web.bat` again

### **Web interface doesn't open**
- Check if port 8765 is blocked by firewall
- Try running as administrator
- Look for error messages in the command window
